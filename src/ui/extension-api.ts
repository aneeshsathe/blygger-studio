/*
 * The Studio's extension surface (docs/extensions.md).
 *
 * This is the only Studio module an extension's UI may import (plus React, the
 * SDK in sdk/dist/browser.js, and files in its own directory);
 * test-ui/extensions.test.ts holds every extension to that. An extension sees
 * what a slot hands it — the entry, the SDK client, a few verbs — and not the
 * app: no collections, no query cache, no router internals.
 *
 * Extensions are compiled in, never loaded at run time: the Studio holds the
 * owner's session, so code that reaches it is code the operator chose to build.
